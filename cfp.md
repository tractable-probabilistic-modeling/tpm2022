We invite three types of submissions:

1) **novel research** on tractable probabilistic modeling
2) **retrospective papers** discussing the impact, consequences, and lessons learned
3) **recently accepted papers** at UAI that present advances in tractable probabilistic models (_in the format used when previously published_)

## Topics of interest

* new tractable representations in logical, continuous and hybrid domains
* learning algorithms for TPMs
* theoretical and empirical analysis of TPMs
* connections between TPM classes
* TPMs for responsible, robust and explainable AI
* approximate inference algorithms with guarantees
* successful applications of TPMs to real-world problems

## Submission Instructions
Submissions are single-blind and should have _up to 4 pages_, excluding references, using the [TPM format](/assets/tpm2022-template.zip).

## Important Dates
* **Submission deadline:** June, 2nd 2022 AoE
* **Notification of acceptance:** July, 5th 2022
