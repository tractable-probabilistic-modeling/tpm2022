We invite three types of submissions:

1) **novel research** on tractable probabilistic modeling
2) **retrospective papers** discussing the impact, consequences, and lessons learned
3) **recently accepted papers** that present advances in tractable probabilistic models (_in the format and length used when previously published_)

## Topics of interest

* new tractable representations in logical, continuous and hybrid domains
* learning algorithms for TPMs
* theoretical and empirical analysis of TPMs
* connections between TPM classes
* TPMs for responsible, robust and explainable AI
* approximate inference algorithms with guarantees
* successful applications of TPMs to real-world problems

## Important Dates
* **Submission deadline:** June, 2nd 2022 AoE
* **Notification of acceptance:** July, 5th 2022
* **Camera-ready version:** TBA
* **Workshop date:** August, 5th 2022

## Submission Instructions
Original papers and retrospective papers are required to follow the style guidelines of UAI 2022 and should be using the following adjusted template [TPM format](/assets/tpm2022-template.zip). Submitted papers should be _up to 4 pages_ long, excluding references. Already accepted papers, can be submitted in the format of the venue they have been accepted to. Supplementary material can be put in the same pdf paper (after references); it is entirely up to the reviewers to decide whether they wish to consult this additional material.

All submissions must be electronic (through the link below), and must closely follow the formatting guidelines in the templates; otherwise they will automatically be rejected. Reviewing for TPM 2022 is single-blind; i.e., reviewers will know the authorsâ€™ identity but authors won't know the reviewers' identity. However, we recommend that you refer to your prior work in the third person wherever possible. We also encourage links to public repositories such as GitHub to share code and/or data.

For any questions, please contact us at [tpmworkshop2022@gmail.com](mailto:tpmworkshop2022@gmail.com)
